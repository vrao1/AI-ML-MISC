- Perform requirements gap analysis and add new requirements as optional requirements for the design

- Please provide a list of requirements elucidated individually in a tabular format with each line item being an independent requirement type for the design

- How would the design be created and what all does the engineer / engineering team have to be do. Create a design plan.

- create automation program in Visual Basic programming language to create the CAD model of the proposed base plate design. You need to develop baseplate designs using a 3D CAD software package (SolidWorks, Autodesk Fusion 360, Openscad, Freecad, Onshape).Please provide a complete code so that it can be executed to create the 3D models in the specified CAD software. Please do not provide code snippet but rather complete executable code.

- Propose the material selected

- Conduct structural analysis for each design and provide a report summarizing the results, including stress calculations, deflection analysis, and safety factor verification.

-  Conduct Safety and Failure Analysis

-  Propose the relevant applicable standards

- Test Plan(s) and Test case generation to evaluate the proposed design(s).

- Manufacturing process recommendation (e.g. 3D printing or CNC or molding etc?)

- Provide a comprehensive report justifying the design choices for each concept, including material selection, connection method, and design features. Compare and contrast the different designs, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages.

-  Produce detailed engineering drawings for each design, including dimensions, tolerances, and material specifications.

- Estimate the manufacturing cost for each design, considering material costs, labor, and manufacturing processes.

-  Present and email the design report to the team, showcasing the different concepts, analysis results, and design justification.
